Any transaction that exceeds your daily limit will be rejected.External Transfers and Business Payments require you to enter a Security Token Code to verify the transaction.If two people have access to the same account through Internet banking, then each user will have their own daily limit.Daily limits reset to zero at approximately midnight.Changing Your Daily LimitYou can request changes to your daily limit using the \"Change my daily limit\" link underneath your accounts section in Internet Banking.

Personal limits are only available if an Account Limit is in place.While an account limit or personal limit is in place for an account, the dollar value of external transfers, BPAY\u00ae, Business Payment Credit files and transfers to another Suncorp Bank account made from that account will not be included in the daily limit for the person registered for Internet Banking (e.g.an account limit will override a daily limit).Limits for Business Payments DebitLimits are in place if you're uploading an ABA file to Internet Banking in order to process a business payment debit.A\u00a0Period\u00a0limit restricts the total dollar value of Business Payment Debit files that can be processed for a particular Debit User during a certain period (eg daily, weekly, monthly).A\u00a0File\u00a0limit restricts the total dollar value of an individual Business payment Debit file that can be processed by a particular Debit user.A\u00a0Transaction\u00a0Limit is set for each Debit user and limits each individual transaction that is contained within the Business Payment Debit File.How Daily Limits Affect Future Dated and Recurring\u00a0TransfersFuture dated and recurring payments that are set up to occur on a future and/or recurring\u00a0date, to both Suncorp Bank and non-Suncorp Bank accounts, will affect the daily limit\u00a0on the date the transfer is processed\u00a0and not on the day of set up.For example if you have a future dated transfer that you setup today the first of February for April 15, your daily limit will be deducted overnight on April 15 when the transaction takes place.Business payments reduce the daily limit\u00a0on the date that they are set up\u00a0regardless of the future date of the transaction.The maximum amount for an immediate transfer is your remaining daily limit, and the maximum amount for a future dated transfer is the full amount of your daily limit.If there is an insufficient amount of your daily limit remaining on the date that the transaction actually occurs, the transaction will usually be rejected on that date, and you will receive a notification of the failure by secure message through internet banking.How Daily Limits Affect Two to Sign AccountsWhen a transaction which is subject to a daily limit is set-up under a two to sign authority, the limit will be deducted from the person\u00a0who sets up the transaction.
